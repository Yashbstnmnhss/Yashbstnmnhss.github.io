            I understand you're crying again?
            Sad?
            But I was here yesterday.
            You're happy too.
            They're both in their voice,
            chatting.
            sy malahan ngehibur sy sendiri.
            If I chat you you always throw it on another topic,
            if you don't say I'm ornate I can't support blah blah blah I did,
            didn't I?
            This is my pure opinion.
            I didn't do it.

            and also,
            you're asking someone else to be nice to you after the robbery.
            But after the guy stole you?
            Well,
            maybe it's because you're close,
            huh?
            You're the same person when you're in good mode.
            I don't know if this is a message we're going in there,

            why can't I just take this as a joke? this is just a joke why am i taking feelings from this? today everything I say is real,
            maybe you guys think of it as a story / pretend.
            but whatever,
            I'm tired of feeling..
            why am i so easily influenced? this is just a joke.
            why? I said that I easily take feelings in everything,
            so forgive me.
            I'm a little crazy,
            yes,
            but this is the truth.
            I'm selfish,
            quick to pick up useless feelings,
            I'm nothing more than trash.
            but it's okay I'm happy.
            so uh abt all of this,
            just forget it,

            我不认为那是演戏。。
            取决于你，
            我累了，谁来假装？如果你不相信这是好的，
            我不是强迫我也厌倦了所有的感觉，
            为什么我不能把这当成玩笑？这只是一个玩笑，我为什么要感受 从这个？今天我所说的一切都是真实的，
            也许你们认为这是一个故事/假装。
            但不管怎样，
            我厌倦了这种感觉。
            为什么我如此容易受到影响？这只是个玩笑。
            为什么？我说过我很容易在任何事情上感受到，
            所以请原谅我。
            我有点疯了，
            对
            但这是事实。
            我很自私，
            很快就拾起无用的感觉，
            我不过是垃圾。
            但没关系，我很高兴。
            所以呃，放弃所有这些，
            算了吧，

            Do they know if I actually have feelings too? I know they mean joking.

            my mother called me "fat" I tried not to eat,
            my efforts were not considered? Now I understand Fuze's feelings,
            do they think I'm a guy like that? won't be okay? because of my voice? I'm seriously crying now.
            I don't know I think it's a joke too but the longer I think about it the more it hurts.
            I know I want to be considered a guy,
            but don't treat me like trash? I've never been considered/looked for Seriously,

            everyone knows that
            he likes me back too
            but we never talk
            i don't know to act infront of him
            we have talk to each other
            few times
            but that's on a call.

            it's no use to be friends again with them, don't be friends with them again. im so tired she said. and then glad saya that she want to move on from you guys but it seems pretty hard. you guys seems make gladys sad, so much. and then i appear, Vallen says that what's going on? and i said that you guys using own language again.
            "Do they know if I actually have feelings too? I know they mean joking.
            but I'm sick,
            you know?,
            my mother called me "fat" I tried not to eat,
            my efforts were not considered? Now I understand Fuze's feelings,
            do they think I'm a guy like that? won't be okay? because of my voice? I'm seriously crying now.
            I don't know I think it's a joke too but the longer I think about it the more it hurts.
            I know I want to be considered a guy,
            but don't treat me like trash? I've never been considered/looked for Seriously,
            I'm asking,
            but later on,

            everyone has the following doubts: 
            Why is the performance of the endurance running test still unsatisfactory when the child insists on running 800-1000 meters every day.
            There are many parents and friends who have added me to WeChat and are asking the same question. 
            As for how to improve endurance running, 
            everyone has the following doubts: 
            Why is the performance of the endurance running test still unsatisfactory when the child insists on running 800-1000 meters every day. 
            This is very similar to the cultural class test.
             Although the full score of a test paper is 100 points,
             it needs more knowledge reserves, 
            and endurance running is the same.
             If you want to achieve good endurance running results,
             your child's physical reserve can be at least 4 kilometers at a constant speed, 
            so practice At that time, 
            only jogging 1,000 meters a day was not enough. 
            Now there is still about a month before the middle school entrance examination. 
            To effectively improve the endurance running performance, 
            we need to let the children jog at least 2 kilometers every day after school and on Saturdays and Sundays. 
            During the running process, 
            you must run at a constant speed and not walk. 
            Try to adjust your breathing and adjust the running rhythm. 
            This will effectively improve your endurance running performance.
