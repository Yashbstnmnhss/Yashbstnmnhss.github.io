                        我不认为那是演戏。。

                        <br />

                        取决于你，

                        <br />

                        我累了，谁来假装？如果你不相信这是好的，

                        <br />

                        我不是强迫我也厌倦了所有的感觉，

                        <br />

                        为什么我不能把这当成玩笑？这只是一个玩笑，我为什么要感受
                        从这个？今天我所说的一切都是真实的，

                        <br />

                        也许你们认为这是一个故事/假装。

                        <br />

                        但不管怎样，

                        <br />

                        <mark>我厌倦了这种感觉。</mark>

                        <br />

                        为什么我如此容易受到影响？这只是个玩笑。

                        <br />

                        为什么？我说过我很容易在任何事情上感受到，

                        <br />

                        所以请原谅我。

                        <br />

                        <mark>我有点疯了，</mark>

                        <br />

                        对

                        <br />

                        但这是事实。

                        <br />

                        我很自私，

                        <br />

                        很快就拾起无用的感觉，

                        <br />

                        <mark><u>我不过是垃圾。</u></mark>

                        <br />

                        但没关系，我很高兴。

                        <br />

                        所以呃，放弃所有这些，

                        <br />

                        算了吧，

                        <br />

                        让我们开始新的一页吧。。

                        <br />

                        所以你认为这是一个故事？书假装？好吧，一切都很好，
