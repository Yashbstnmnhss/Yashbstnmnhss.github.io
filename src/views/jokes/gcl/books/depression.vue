                Do they know if I actually have feelings too? I know they mean joking.
                <br />
                <mark>but I'm sick,</mark>
                <br />
                you know?,
                <br />
                my mother
                <mark>called me "fat"</mark>
                I tried not to eat,
                <br />
                my efforts were not considered?
                <strong>Now I understand Fuze's feelings,</strong>
                <br />
                do they think I'm a guy like that? won't be okay? because of my voice? I'm seriously
                crying now.
                <br />
                I don't know I think it's a joke too but the longer I think about it the more it
                hurts.
                <br />
                I know I want to be considered a guy,
                <br />
                but don't
                <mark>treat me like trash?</mark>
                I've never been considered/looked for Seriously,
                <br />
                I'm asking,
                <br />
                but later on,
                <br />

                <br />
