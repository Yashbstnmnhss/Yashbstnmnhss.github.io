                I understand you're crying again? <br>
                Sad? <br>
                But I was here yesterday. <br>
                You're happy too. <br>
                They're both in their voice, <br>
                chatting. <br>

                If I chat you you always throw it on another topic, <br>
                if you don't say I'm ornate I can't support blah blah blah
                I did, <br>
                didn't I? <br>
                This is my pure opinion. <br>
                I didn't do it. <br>

                Oh, <br>
                and also, <br>
                you're asking someone else to be nice to you after the robbery. <br>
                But after <mark>the guy stole you?</mark> <br>
                Well, <br>
                maybe it's because you're close, <br>
                huh? <br>
                You're the same person when you're in good mode. <br>
                I don't know if this is a message we're going in there, <br>
                but you. <br>
