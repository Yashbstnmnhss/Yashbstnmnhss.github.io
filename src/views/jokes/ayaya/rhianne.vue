        i do not feel comfortable, at all.<br />is this your take in trying to seem like you have
        the upper hand?<br />i hope you understand that everyone has their vey own reasons.<br />
        if you cannot respect my privacy, then do not expect me to give you good treatment.<br />i
        ask of you to delete the picture, if you would be so kind.<br />
        thank you.<br />???<br />
        do you expect me to not have a life and be required to reply to anyone?<br />i do not reply
        on a daily basis, you know?<br />even my friends in real life <br />and i hope that clears
        it up ??<br />can you not take someone seriously for having a life <br />if you're wondering
        why i am online when tweeting, i treat twitter as my personal diary.<br />
        almost nobody messages me here, so i basically just ignore the whole message feature.<br />i
        do not see why i need to reply to everyone unless it is urgent.<br />for my privacy?<br />likecan
        you not respect privacyif someone were to leak your private information without consent,
        would you just leave it be and not take action?<br />its still my picturesand i feel
        uncomfortable.<br />
        its weird and creepy.<br />and its not funnylol just because someone doesnt want to play
        genshin with you, you now just, leak their info and stuff?<br />
        crazy shit bullshit even lol and to think YOU used to like me?<br />
        men like you are disgusting then why'd you leak my pictures?<br />would you like me to leak
        your private information?<br />

        haha hilarious ang funny mo naman <br />
        no bullshit <br />
        for being disrespectful imagine going to school and being uneducated <br />
        no wonder why you pull no bitche 'cause you don't know how to reply?<br />
        your fragile masculinity really is noticeable <br />
